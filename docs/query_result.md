# Query result

> After querying the genotypes, you will have a table which displays the
> alleles for each 3KRG variety in a row, for all SNP positions within
> the specified region or gene. By default, the varieties are sorted by
> decreasing number of allele mismatches. The resulting table can be
> filtered using any of the column values, and sorted based on any
> column value by clicking the column header.

It will also report a graph of the allele frequencies where you can
inspect the major and minor alleles per subpopulation for all SNP
positions from the query.
