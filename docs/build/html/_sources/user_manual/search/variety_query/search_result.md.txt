Varieties search result


The final result is the intersection of varieties that satisfy all constraints as specified in Country, Subpopulation, Passport and Phenotype filters. The resulting set of varieties can be viewed as a table, or in a phylogenetic tree or MDS plot.


**Table**  - This lists the varieties satisfying the constraints sorted by name. Selecting a variety from this list will display its Variety passport and phenotype data. The user can create a **Variety List** from the query result by providing a **List Name** then clicking the **Create List** button. The created list can then be used for further analysis.

**Phylotree**  - The phylogenetic tree of the result is dynamically computed  based on SNP values from 200,000 random positions between the varieties. The varieties are colored based on their subpopulation, and clicking the node displays the Variety passport and phenotype data.

**MDS Plot** - The MDS (Multidimensional Scaling) Plot displays the distances between every varietry pairs of the resulting set into two-dimensional projection. It uses the same distance matrix as with the phylogenetic tree. The variety nodes are colored based on subpopulation, and clicking the node displays the Variety passport and phenotype data.
