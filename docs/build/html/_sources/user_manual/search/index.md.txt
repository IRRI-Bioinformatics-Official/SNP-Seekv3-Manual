SNP-Seek provides a versatile search functionality that allows users to efficiently find specific genetic information using three distinct criteria: genotype, variety, and gene locus.

1. **Search by Genotype (SNP Query)**: This feature enables users to enter a specific genotype to retrieve relevant data. It is especially beneficial for researchers and breeders looking to focus on particular genetic traits or variations present in their samples.

2. **Search by Variety (Variety Query)**: Users can search for genetic information by specifying a particular variety. This feature is ideal for those analyzing genetic data linked to specific crops or plant varieties, thereby facilitating targeted research and breeding programs.

3. **Search by Gene Locus (Locus Query)**: This option allows users to search for information based on specific gene loci. By entering the desired gene locus, users can access detailed genetic data, which is crucial for understanding genetic markers and their implications in plant genetics.
