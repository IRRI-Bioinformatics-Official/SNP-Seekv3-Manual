# 6. Downloading the results table

Download the table in "**Plink**" format by clicking on the "**Plink**" button.

This will give you two files in a zipped folder: a **ped** and **map** file that by now you should be familiar with.

The first few lines of your downloaded **.map** file should look like this:

```{image} /_static/image10.png
:alt:
:width: 600px
:class: zoomable
:align: center
```

Likewise, the first few lines of your **.ped** file should be like this:

```{image} /_static/image11.png
:alt:
:width: 600px
:class: zoomable
:align: center
```
