# Why do group alleles in haplotype view keep changing?

This behaviour had to do with the internal stochasticity of the K-means algorithm, which is employed when deciding on the "best" number of clusters. As such, changing results indicate there is no clear-cut "best" number of clusters.

This behaviour will be changed in future, but please read the answer to the next Q.
