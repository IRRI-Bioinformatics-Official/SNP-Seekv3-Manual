# 7. Add positions in my list

From the **map** file, remove the middle columns such that only the 1st column and the last columns remain (chr, position).

Go to "**My lists**". Select "**SNP**" in List Type. Click on "**Create**" to make a new list.

Paste the chr-position table from the map file.

You may tick the box on "**Verify if SNP is in Variant set**". However, in this hands-on, we will not do that since we know that these SNPs already came as a result of the genotype query.
