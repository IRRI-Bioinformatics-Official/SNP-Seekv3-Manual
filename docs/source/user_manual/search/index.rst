Search
==========================

SNP-Seek offers a versatile search functionality that enables users to efficiently locate specific genetic information based on three distinct criteria: genotype, variety, and gene locus.

1. **Search by Genotype**: This feature allows users to input a specific genotype to retrieve related data. This can be particularly useful for researchers and breeders who wish to focus on particular genetic traits or variations present in their samples.
2. **Search by Variety**: Users can search for genetic information by specifying a particular variety. This is ideal for those looking to analyze genetic data associated with a specific crop or plant variety, facilitating targeted research and breeding programs.
3. **Search by Gene Locus**: This option enables users to search for information based on specific gene loci. By entering the desired gene locus, users can access detailed genetic data, which is essential for understanding genetic markers and their implications in plant genetics.
