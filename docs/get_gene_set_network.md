# Get Gene set/network

> Using the gene list we generated, we will now do a gene enrichment
> analysis to know if there are other genes previously reported that are
> associated with our QTL of interest.
>
> To do this, go to "Search"-\> "Gene Loci.
>
> Set as Reference genome: "Japonica Nipponbare".
>
> Set Search to: "Gene set/networks".
>
> Set Gene Models to: "All".
>
> Set the My Locus List to: "qDTF2_genes".
>
> Tick "Ricenetv2 direct neighbors" and "AgriGO".
>
> Click on "Gene set/enrichment".

> Unfortunately, this query will not return any result. Click the "Go"
