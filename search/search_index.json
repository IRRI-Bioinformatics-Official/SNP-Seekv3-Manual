In both cases the query region can be specified either by chromosomal position, or by gene locus. Steps to query SNPs Specifiy varieties To compare alleles between two varieties - type the Variety names in the two boxes. The text boxes have auto-completion feature so one only needs to type the first few characters then select from the drop-down list. To compare reference with a subpopulation - select the subpopulation from the listbox. Some items in a choices is a group of more than one subpopulation, all indica (ind1,ind2,ind3,indx), all japonica (temp,trop,temp/trop,trop/temp) and all varieties To compare reference with a list of varieties - select the variety list name in My Variety List, which are defined in My Lists. Specify genome region Select the Reference Genome - select among the five sequenced rice genomes to use as reference genome (Japonica Nipponbare, 93-11, IR64-21, DJ123, Kasalath). The chromosome/scaffold and gene locus selections depends on the selected reference genome. To sepecify Chromosome/Scaffold region - select the chromosome/scaffold name, type the start and end base positions. Chromosome is avaiable when a fully assembled genome (Nipponbare, Kasalath) is selected, otherwise (IR64-21, DJ123) scaffold is used. 93-11 has both chromosomes and scaffolds. To specify Gene locus - type the Gene locus name in the text box. For Nipponbare, we are using the MSU Rice Genome Annotation Project annotations ( http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/ ), so gene loci names are of the form LOC_OSXXgYYYYY. For the other 4 reference genomes, we are proposing a new locus naming convention described below. The gene text box also has auto-completion feature. When a locus is selected, the chromosomal position boxes are filled by the selected gene's position. Set options Show all reference alleles \u2013 The alleles of all 5 reference genomes is display for each SNP position. Show Nipponbare positions - since the bulk of our SNPs are called against Nipponbare, it is stored in the database using Nipponbare position. When another genome (non-Nipponbare) is used as reference, Nipponbare positions are converted into the basepair coordinate of the selected reference using the genome-wide pairwwise alignment data. Check this option to also display the Nipponbare positions, along with the converted positions. SNP coloring determines the color of alleles as displayed in the table and in the Genome Browser. Options are: Reference mismatch \u2013 SNPs which have polymorphism with the reference are colored red, while the rest is white. Nucleotide \u2013 SNPs are colored based on the base nucleotide: A green, T red, G orange, C blue. This follows the JBrowse color code. Core SNPs only -- if checked, will query only the Core SNPs (500,000) instead of the SNP universe (20M). The core set was generated using statistical criteria. Mismatch Only -- if checked, only SNPs having allele mismatches are fetched in the two-variety comparison Reset button is provided to clear all input fields. Display or Download To download the result, click the CSV or Tab button to get the given format. To Display the result in a Table, or view in JBrowse or a Tree, click the Search button. All Varieties result views Three views are available for SNP query results Table - this view displays the Alleles for each variety in a row, for all SNP positions within the specified region or gene. The color is based on SNP coloring selected. The table is displayed in several pages, depending on the number of returned varieties. Note that only varieties having at least one reference mismatch are returned, and the varieties are sorted by decreasing number of allele mismatches. Due to its typlical large size, the result is displayed in several pages and the number of varieties per page depends on the length of the query region. JBrowse \u2013 the JBrowse genome browser lays out the SNP genotyping result in the SNP Genotyping track. Each variety is represented as a thin row in the track, and sorted in the same order as in the table. This track is dynamically generated from the query result, and covers only the queried region or locus. Zooming out from the initial region gives empty rows at both sides. To view a wider region, do a query again specifying the new wider region. Unlike in the Table view where results are displayed in several pages, Jbrowse displays all varieties having allele mismatch in the queried region at once. PhyloTree -- Using the number of allele mismatches between varieties within the queried region or gene to compute for distance, the phylogenetic tree is constructed by Neighbor-Joining alorithm. Note that this operation takes some time (~3 minutes for a typical gene length). Two varieties result views For two varieties query, results can be viewed in a table or in JBrowse. Table - when two varieties are compared, the result is a list of SNP position within the specified region. The allele of the reference, and the two varieties for each position are displayed in a row. Polymorphism between the two varieties is highlighted with color red. JBrowse \u2013 the JBrowse tab displays the SNPs of the two varieties within the genome, along with the genes. The boxes are colored based on the selected SNP coloring option. Gene Locus Naming Except for Nipponbare, the four new rice genomes haven't assigned gene locus names yet. The available GFF files for gene annotations still use the gene annotation pipelines' default (like FGENESH, Maker-P). To integrate all these genomes into IRIC, it is therefore necessary that we assign them locus names for uniformity and easy recall. And we propose this scheme: Gene name starts with Os. Os stands for Oryza sativa. Next 5 characters define the variety: Nippo -- Nipponbare 9311_ -- 9311 Kasal -- Kasalath DJ12_ -- DJ123 IR64_ -- IR64 If there is a chromosome assembly, the next 2 digits are the chromosome number. If there is no chromosome assembly, then the next 5 digits are the contig number. A contig number is a rank of the contigs sorted by length. The longest contig has number 1. If contigs are of the same length, they are sorted by their sequence in alphabetical order. The next character is g. g stands for genomic. Instead of g can be m for mitochondrial DNA or c for chloroplast DNA. The next 6 digits are the gene number in the sequence with increment of 50. The first gene should have number 010050, the second 010100, the third 010150, etc. Gene names in the chromosomes will be preserved in future versions of annotations. Gene names in scaffolds are for temporary use. Alternatively spliced gene models or different versions of the same gene prediction are distinguished by a number added at the end of the gene after the dot. Here are some examples: OsNippo01g210150.1, OsIR64_00342g210150.1, Os9311_11g210150.1, OsDJ12_00342g210150.1 We also propose to combine the MSU7 and RAP gene annotations for Nipponbare, and rename the combined gene loci following the scheme above.

In both either case, the query region can be specified either by chromosomal region, by gene locus, or by a list of positions. Steps to query SNPs Specifiy varieties To compare alleles between two varieties - in the two pairwise boxes, type or select from the drop-down list the varieties to compare. The text boxes have auto-completion feature so you only need to type the first few characters then select from the drop-down list. The choice items and recognized terms can be the variety name or accession based on the selected button at the right. To compare the reference with a subpopulation - select the subpopulation from the listbox. Some items in a choices is a group of more than one subpopulation, all indica (ind1,ind2,ind3,indx), all japonica (temp,trop,temp/trop,trop/temp) and all varieties To compare reference with a list of varieties - select the variety list name in My Variety List, which are defined in My Lists. Specify genome region Select the Reference Genome - select among the five sequenced rice genomes to use as reference genome (Japonica Nipponbare, 93-11, IR64-21, DJ123, Kasalath). The chromosome/scaffold and gene locus selections depends on the selected reference genome. Check Show all reference alleles \u2013 to display the alleles of all 5 reference genomes for each SNP position. The alleles and position conversions between reference genomes are based on pairwise alignment results. To sepecify Chromosome/Scaffold region - select the chromosome/scaffold name, type the start and end base positions. Chromosome is avaiable when a fully assembled genome (Nipponbare, Kasalath) is selected, otherwise (IR64-21, DJ123) scaffold is used. 93-11 has both chromosomes and scaffolds. To specify Gene locus - type the Gene locus name in the text box. For Nipponbare, we are using the MSUv7 (LOC_OSXXgYYYYYY), RAP (OsXXgYYYYYY), and our merged MSUv71,RAP,FGenesh++ (OsNippoXXgYYYYYY) gene loci names described in NAR Supplementary Materials. For the other 4 reference genomes, we are proposing a new locus naming convention also described below. The gene text box also has auto-completion feature. When a locus is selected, the chromosomal position boxes are automatically filled with the selected gene's region. To use a list of SNP positions, select the SNP List previously defined. To use a list of gene loci, select the Locus List previously defined. A genotype can be defined from a SNP List with allele value for each position. You can Match Genotype between this list and all varieties in the selected dataset. The resulting varieties are ranked by the number of matches with the SNP List. Instead of providing a SNP Liist, the genotype could be that of the selected Variety at the specified region. Set options Include indels - include indels in the query Show phenotype - include the values of the selected phenotype in the results table Dataset - select the dataset to query (3kRGP, HDRA, both). If both is selected, there is addition option to use either the union or intersection of the SNP positions. SNP coloring determines the color of alleles as displayed in the table and in the Genome Browser. Options are: Reference mismatch \u2013 SNPs which have polymorphism with the reference are colored red, while the rest is white. Nucleotide \u2013 SNPs are colored based on the base nucleotide: A green, T red, G orange, C blue. This follows the JBrowse color code. 3k SNP Set - select the subset of the 3kRGP SNPs to query (All 32M, Base 18M, Filtered 4.8M, Core 400k). The subsetting criteria is described below. Mismatch Only -- if checked, only SNPs having allele mismatches are fetched in the pairwise comparison, or having mismatch with the reference in the multiple comparison. Include SNPs -- select to include/exclude/highlight Non-synonymous SNPs. Missing allele - specify how missing allele is to be counted (ignore means 0 match, 0 mismatch; or 0.5 match 0.5 mismatch) Search - to perform query and display the result in a Table, or view in JBrowse or a Tree For queries above 50kb region, or 5000 SNPs, or 10 gene loci, the results are not displayed but available for download only. Maximum allowed queries are 5Mb region, or 500k SNPs, or 1000 gene loci. Reset - clear all input fields. All Varieties result views Several views are available for SNP query results Table - this view displays the Alleles for each variety in a row, for all SNP positions within the specified region or gene. The color is based on SNP coloring selected. The varieties are sorted by decreasing number of allele mismatches by default. The resulting table can be filtered using any of the column values, and sorted based on any column value by clicking the column header. To download the result, click the CSV, Tab, Plink or Flapjack button to get the given format. At the bottom of the table is the plot showing the allele/genotype frequencies/counts for all SNP positions in the queried region. JBrowse \u2013 the JBrowse genome browser lays out the SNP genotyping result in the SNP Genotyping track. Each variety is represented as a thin row in the track, and sorted in the same order as in the table. This track is dynamically generated from the query result, and covers only the queried region or locus. Zooming out from the initial region gives empty rows at both sides. To view a wider region, do a query again specifying the new wider region. Unlike in the Table view where results are displayed in several pages, Jbrowse displays all varieties having allele mismatch in the queried region at once. PhyloTree -- Using the number of allele mismatches between varieties within the queried region or gene to compute for distance, the phylogenetic tree is constructed by Neighbor-Joining alorithm. Note that this operation takes some time (~5 minutes for a typical gene length). Compare genomes -- Displays the alignment of the selected reference and region with the 4 other reference genomes in Vista. Alignment \u2013 view the results in the familiar multiple sequence alignment format. But not that the positions here are not contiguous. It uses the JSAV library. Querying Indels - include INDELs in the query, check the Include Indels checkbox. The indels are displayed in multiple sequence alignment format along with te SNPs. For insertions, the insertion string is inserted in each variety while the reference sequence is shifted right with gaps (-) equal to the longest insertion. For deletion, the reference alleles are inserted to the reference of length equal to the longest deletion, while gaps (-) are inserted to the varieties. The positions are colored green and blue for insertion and deletion regions, respectively. Multiple Reference Genome Select the reference genome to use as coordinate (Japonica Nipponbare, IR64-21, DJ123, 93-11, Kasalath) Check Show all reference alleles - display the alleles in the queried region of the 5 reference genomes Two varieties result views For two varieties query, results can be viewed in a table or in JBrowse. Table - when two varieties are compared, the result is a list of SNP position within the specified region. The allele of the reference, and the two varieties for each position are displayed in a row. Polymorphism between the two varieties is highlighted with color red. JBrowse \u2013 the JBrowse tab displays the SNPs of the two varieties within the genome, along with the genes. The boxes are colored based on the selected SNP coloring option. from NAR 2016, Supplementary Materials Nipponbare merged gene models and names Four major annotations for Nipponbare \u2013 MSU v7 (16), RAP-representative, RAP-predicted (17) and Fgenesh++ (18) \u2013 were added as tracks in JBrowse (https://snp-seek.irri.org/_jbrowse.zul). To facilitate curating results, we merged these four annotations into one set of loci. Having a single set of loci simplifies query and analysis of genome and variant features, like non-synonymous SNPs. The strategy for merging gene loci was: Collect all gene (locus) features from all 4 annotations. Sort all loci by chromosome and by start and end positions. Determine loci that have at least 50% overlap for the coding region (CDS) and merge those from the same strand into a common, new locus. The merged locus is named using the convention described in Supplement II with the form OsNippo{YY}g{NNNNNN}, where YY is the chromosome number (01-12), and NNNNNN is the locus count for the chromosome, starting from 10050, with increment of 50. Each locus is also referenced back to their original ID using the Dbxref attribute. Synonyms and Ontology terms (GO, PO, TO) collected from Oryzabase (21) are also added to the created locus in the Alias and Ontology term attributes. These synonyms and ontology attributes are loaded in the CHADO database. The gene function from MSU7 is used for the merged locus, unless it is \u2018hypothetical\u2019, \u2018unknown\u2019, or \u2018expressed\u2019. For these cases, the functional annotation from RAP is used. Reference genomes gene locus names We used the gene models published with each of the genomes. These models use the name originally provided by their respective gene prediction/curation pipelines. To avoid displaying these cryptic names in the viewers and queries, we define a naming convention for rice gene models for any newly sequenced reference genome. Collect all gene (locus) features from the original source. Sort all loci by chromosome and start and end positions. Gene names start with \u201cOs\u201d for Oryza sativa, and the next five characters define the variety: \u201cNippo\u201d (Nipponbare), \u201c9311_\u201d (93-11), \u201cKasal\u201d (Kasalath), \u201cDJ123\u201d (DJ 123) and \u201cIR64_\u201d (IR 64). Assign chromosome or contig number: If there is chromosome assembly, the next 2 digits are the chromosome number (\u201c01\u201d-\u201c12\u201d). If there is no chromosome assembly, then the next 5 digits are the contig number. The contig number is a rank given to the contigs sorted by decreasing length, where the longest is assigned \u201c00001\u201d. If contigs are of the same length, they are sorted by the sequence in alphabetical order. The next character is \u201cg\u201d, which stands for genomic DNA. Instead of \u201cg\u201d, it can be \u201cm\u201d for mitochondrial or \u201cc\u201d for chloroplast DNA. With genes sorted by start and then by end positions, the next 6 digits are the gene number in the chromosome or contig with an increment of 50. The first gene is assigned number \u201c010050\u201d, the second \u201c010100\u201d, the third \u201c010150\u201d, etc. Gene names in the chromosomes will be preserved in future versions of annotations. Gene names in scaffolds/contigs are for temporary use. Each locus is also referenced back to their original ID as provided by the source in the Dbxref attribute. If available, synonyms and Ontology terms (GO, PO, TO) are also added to the created locus in the Alias and Ontology term attributes. Alternatively spliced gene models or different versions of the same gene prediction are distinguished by a number added at the end of the gene after the dot. Here are some examples: \u201cOsNippo01g210150.1\u201d, \u201cOsIR64_00342g210150.1\u201d, \u201cOs9311_11g210150.1\u201d, \u201cOsDJ12_00342g210150.1\u201d. Each mRNA has its own list of features (CDS, exon, 3\u2019-UTR and 5\u2019-UTR) collected from the original annotation source, with descriptors following the transcript name. The transcript name is followed by \u201c:\u201d (colon), then the feature type using Sequence Ontology terms (\u201ccds\u201d, \u201cexon\u201d, \u201cfive_prime_UTR\u201d, \u201cthree_pime_UTR\u201d), a \u201c.\u201d (dot), and the last two digits are the order number. Examples are: \u201cOsNippo01g210150.1:cds.01\u201d and \u201cOs9311_11g210150.2:exon.01\u201d.

The table matrix showing the accession with variation in the region will be returned. There are 78 varieties that shown variation in this region. The table matrix is downloaded in CSV to further examine the region. Results can be downloaded as CSV format by clicking the CSV box in the Download section. B. Finding varieties from the 3K panel that is similar to a particular variety. Trait: 100-grain weight. Use Genotype to search across all varieties. Supply the information for region of interest. Choose 100-grain weight in the Show phenotype drop down menu. Untick Mismatch only box. The matrix table for 3024 accession will be returned with the 100-grain weight column. Sort the accessions by 100-grain weight phenotype data by clicking on 100-grain weight column. Use the accession with the heaviest value as reference for the rest of the 3k panel by choosing the Accession in the variety drop down menu in the Region section. The matrix table for 3024 accession will be returned.","title":"Use cases"},{"location":"Use%20cases/#_1","text":"C.

Inspecting this downloaded SNP matrix, there were 1,125 SNP positions discovered within this region, while no SNPs (blanks) were seen using Nipponbare genome, as expected. Without the Kasalath reference information, variant discovery would be impossible using the Nipponbare reference genome. These SNP positions can now be further examined and surrounding sequences extracted for Pstol1 marker assay design.","title":""},{"location":"Use%20cases/#_3","text":"","title":""},{"location":"Use%20cases/#_4","text":"","title":""},{"location":"Use%20cases/#_5","text":"D.

It can also retrieve passport and phenotypic data for a given Variety or IRIS ID. To get Variety information: Select the Dataset to search (3kRGP, HDRA) Type in the Designation or IRIS ID or Accession at their corresponding boxes, which have auto-completion feature. Only one of these fields should be specified. The results are Passport data listed at the left panel and Phenotypes with values at the right. The meaning of the values are explained in the Passport data dictionary and Phenotype data dictionary. The nearest relatives can be explored using the MDS plot centered at the selected variety. To search varieties from a country and/or a subpopulation Type in the country and/or the subpopulation at their corresponding auto-complete boxes. If both are specified, the resulting set of varieties satisfy both constraints. The examples below query for varieties from the Philippines. To search varieties by phenotype and/or passport data Varieties can also be filtered using any number of passport values: Select the passport field from the list. The valid values for the selected field is listed in the adjacent listbox. Set the field value from the list. Click the Add button to add more passport constraint. To search varieties by phenotype data Varieties can also be filtered using any number of phenotype values: Select the phenotype field from the list. The phenotypes listed may be limited only to descendants of terms from the Rice Trait Ontology (CO_320) or Plant Trait Ontology (TO). The valid values for the selected field is listed in the adjacent listbox. Select the comparator as = (equals), < (less than) or > (greater than), and value from the list. Click the Add button to add more phenotype constraints. To search varieties by Rice Crop (CO_320) or Plant Trait Ontology (TO) The traits are mapped to Crop and Trait Ontology terms. The traits can be selected to belong to the selected CO/TO terms. Select the CO_320 or TO term from the list. The list of phenotypes in the last phenotype contraint listbox is limited only to descendants of the selected CO/TO term. Set phenotype constraint as describe above. Varieties search result The final result is the intersection of varieties that satisfy all constraints as specified in Country, Subpopulation, Passport and Phenotype filters. The resulting set of varieties can be viewed as a table, or in a phylogenetic tree or MDS plot. Table - This lists the varieties satisfying the constraints sorted by name. Selecting a variety from this list will display its Variety passport and phenotype data. The user can create a Variety List from the query result by providing a List Name then clicking the Create List button. The created list can then be used for further analysis. Phylotree - The phylogenetic tree of the result is dynamically computed based on SNP values from 200,000 random positions between the varieties. The varieties are colored based on their subpopulation, and clicking the node displays the Variety passport and phenotype data. MDS Plot - The MDS (Multidimensional Scaling) Plot displays the distances between every varietry pairs of the resulting set into two-dimensional projection. It uses the same distance matrix as with the phylogenetic tree. The variety nodes are colored based on subpopulation, and clicking the node displays the Variety passport and phenotype data.
